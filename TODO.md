# todo

- tab complete for project names
#- http caching and perhaps more aggresive (e.g. for project names and users)
- '--cc' field in `jirash createissue` to add watchers. Perhaps '-w', '--watch'.

# someday/maybe

- setting a current ticket. Would this be useful? Or too weird. Prior art?
    $ jirash cd MON-113   # persist? Perhaps just in current env? Then need a bash function driver.
    $ jirash comment
    blah blah
    .
- convert everything to rest since soap is deprecated
